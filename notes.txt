Go to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
If you don't already have a Google Cloud account, create one and sign in.
Once you are signed in, select your project from the project dropdown menu at the top of the page.
Go to the APIs & Services section of the Cloud Console.
Click on the Credentials tab and look for the API key in the list of credentials.
Check the restrictions on the API key to see if it has been restricted to specific IP addresses or websites. If the key has been restricted and the website or IP address you are using to test it is not on the list, it will not work.
You can also try using the API key in your code and see if it works. If the key is invalid, you will receive an error message.
